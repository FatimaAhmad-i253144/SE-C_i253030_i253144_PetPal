                <br>
                    PetPal was founded by two pet lovers, just like yourselves! Our founders, Fatima and Fatima felt the need
                    for healthy meals for pets in a market saturated by mass-produced junk.
                    Inspired by their own cats, the two set out to create a brand for the pets.
                    Meals that were right for their stomachs. Hence our slogan, Right meals, for the right companion, was born.
                    After years of effort, PetPal was launched in 2023. Since then, we have provided thousands of healthy meals 
                    to thousands of happy pets. For us, our priority is always your pets.
